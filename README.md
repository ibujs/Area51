Project Area51, a tiny project to enable access to stored files. Basically, specify a folder to it on your local filesystem, and you'll be able to access it from anywhere, being able to download your files and entering folders. I developed this to bypass my school's website blocking stuff and get quick access to my files and stuff (like fetching random scripts which wreck the system lol). Yes, there is no authentication or uploading files support right now, but I'll add it later :P
This project is based entirely on Next.js (framework for SSR rendering), Express, React and ES2017/ESNext JavaScript. Thus it serves as an example for React SSR using Next.js, and also requesting data from Express from the front-end. (NOTE that I am just beginning work on the Express back-end.)

# Supported browsers:
- Chrome 41+
- Firefox 31 ESR+
- Opera 28+
- All releases of Microsoft Edge (gj Microsoft with the ES6+ support)
- Safari 9+
- iOS 9+
INTERNET EXPLORER NOT SUPPORTED. Not even IE 11. GO upgrade your browser.
Please? No. Go mess with .babelrc and compile it from scratch. Blame Microsoft or go use Edge.

# The ultimate guide to using Area51.
### Work in progress, lol. Will fix this up in 2-3 days.

# More to come.
