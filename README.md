Project Area51, a tiny project to enable access to stored files. Basically, I developed this to bypass my school's website blocking stuff and get quick access to my files and stuff for some stuff *cough*. It's also a working example of SSR with React and Next.js. This project is based entirely on Next.js (framwork for SSR rendering), React and ES2017/ESNext JavaScript.

# Supported browsers:
- Chrome 41+
- Firefox 31 ESR+
- Opera 28+
- All releases of Microsoft Edge (gj Microsoft with the ES6+ support)
- Safari 9+
- iOS 9+
INTERNET EXPLORER NOT SUPPORTED. Not even IE 11. GO upgrade your browser.
Please? No. Go mess with .babelrc and compile it from scratch. Blame Microsoft or go use Edge.

# The ultimate guide to using Area51.
### Work in progress, lol. Will fix this up in 2-3 days.

# More to come.
